### Questions

1. If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society would be obviated?
- 
2. Ethics creates a dichotomy between the comfort of the individual and the longevity, or mere existance, of the group. Give an example of an extreme case from recent history that favored the group to the detriment of the individual. How would you embed the principle of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself? Be specific.
- the industrial revolutoin, 
3. **(BONUS)** Ethical codes are vulnerable to the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). An ethical code relies on the _cooperation_ of the individuals. Discuss how rogue behavior (aka _defection_) with respect to the ethical code of a group gives rise to the [prinsoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma) and the eventual demise of the ethical code. What incentives can you build in the ethical code that would counteract the attractiveness of defection and, as a result, would mitigate the danger to the code?

### Class Activities
 
1. In a small group up to 5 people, imagine you are a small _tech_ startup. Then:
   1. List the group members below.
   - Hayden 
   - Dwhight
   - Denika
   - Jose
   2. Pick a president and write their name below.
   - Dwight
   3. Describe your technical innovation below.
   - Facial Reconization Cameras w/ database for home security
   
2. Describe the ways your innovation, if realized, would affect society. 
   1. Below, list at least 3 adverse effects (including but not limited to _misuse_) of the innovation and anticipatory actions and           mechanisms you can embed that
   - That potinetally that people causing this aspect to come into play will play a role where no one will be free of public privacy.
   - Citizens tracked in the system with crimes and other forms of illegal activities will have no privacy
   - Racially profiling within a given local database.
  
  2. Below, give an _explicit_ definition of the fine line between the benefit and detriment of your innovation at two moments of its        lifetime: (i) immediately upon launch; (ii) after enough time for it to be absorbed into everyday life.
  
   ### immediately upon launch
   - The benefit of the innovation begins with allowing convinent safe security from your own home.
   - The detriment would begin with the privacy of an indivual that is underage in the being of their own home for the companies side.
  
   ### after enough time for it to be absorbed into everyday life
   - Buiding a strong community of a safe well being for inviduals to make people who commit crimes to take notice that living above the      law isnt their choice anymore.

3. Your small "[band of merry psychopaths](#the-band)" are the pivotal social kernel that can define the proper use of your technology.    You have to start early, and hold the line. How are you going to ensure that you stay the course? 
   - First, by making it aware that crimes can be stopped before they happen & that the police force that serves and protects our            commnities cannot always be in the right place at the right time and sometimes being to far away from the situation can be pivital      for an indivual for life or death.  This techology will primarily foucus on providing safe lifestyles for an individual and or most      importantly your family.  Wondering what if will be the thing of the past & protecting in the moment is the way to look at secutity      that doesnt use pyschical force.
1. Below, define a Code of Ethics (aka Code of Conduct) for your organization that will safeguard your original intentions and values      while not stiflying innovation as your startup grows and matures. Your code should have _at most 9 points_.
   - How a company identifies the main aspects of how the company operates in relation to its workers and consumers. 
    1 - seek discomfort to explore the values of one another
    2 - 
    3 -

4. **(BONUS)** Ethical codes are vulnerable to _hostile takeover_ of the adopting organization. Pick one person from your group and let    them _remove 3 points_ from your Code, at their discretion, to be the most damaging overall. 
   1. Below, discuss how and why the Code has been weakened.
   2. Below, discuss how, in retrospect, you should have stated the points of the Code, to make it _robust to disruption_. _Note: Beware of the [paradox of self-amendment](https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/psaessay.htm), which, in short, **"...arises when a rule is used as the authority for its own amendment. It is sharper when the rule of change is supreme, sharper still when it is changed into a form that is inconsistent with its original form, and sharpest of all when the change purports to be irrevocable."**_
